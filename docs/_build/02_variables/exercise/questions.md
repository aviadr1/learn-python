# help for str.split() function
print the help for the function str.split



# split a string

1. create the following string, and put it in a variable called `sent`
```
"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
```

2.  then **split** it into a list 
    so that each word is an an element in the list. <br> 
    and put the result into another variable called `words`
    
   
3. print the variable `words`

expected ouput:
```
['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
```



# str.join()

1. use the function `help` to read the documentation for the str.join function
1. read this code
```
mylist = ["one", "two", "three"]
result = " ".join(mylist)
print(result)
```
   1. can you guess what this code does ? 
   1. what is the function join?
   1. use help or documentation online if you can't guess
   1. copy this code to the cell below and run it to see if you were right




# using str.upper() and str.join()

1. split the sentence `"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"` into words using the function .split() 
   and put the result in a variable called `words` .
   

2. replace the the words "dog" and "fox" in the `words` list with *uppercase* "DOG" and "FOX" <br>

   HINTS:
   * use the .upper() function
   * use indexing like `words[3]` to acccess a particular word in the `words` list
   
   
3. use the function join to convert the list back into a string


4. print the result
   
expected output:
```
"the quick brown FOX jumped over the lazy DOG"
```



# Dictionary

1. create a dictionary that maps the name of cheeses to prices of 100mg of that cheese.

        gouda costs 4.99 
        Edam costs 2.45
        Camambert costs 7.75
        Bree costs 7.27
    
1. without using "head math", compute the costs of gouda, edam and camambert together
